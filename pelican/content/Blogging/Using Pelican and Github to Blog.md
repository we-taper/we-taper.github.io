Summary: Using Pelican to generate static website and push to Github to blog.

#1. Install Pelican

**Note :** Before reading this article, a quick scan over 
[Jykell Install]({filename}../Blogging/Using Jekyll and Github to Blog (Failed).md) would be very helpful in building a basic knowledge.
<!-- Here's a internal link to Using Jekyll and Github to Blog (Failed).md -->

##1.1 What, *"Static Website"* ?

See: [Wikipedia: Static Website][wiki_sw]


##1.2 Which static website generator?

A great website: [Static Site Generators - The definitive listing of Static Site Generators][ssg_list]



I choose: Pelican, because it's the best one written in python. Getting those written
in Ruby run on windows could be a nightmare. 

##1.3 Install
See: [Installation pip](http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installing.html)

I Tried install pelican through **pip** but failed. **pip** reports Failure every time I tried.

So I switched to **easy_install**

See [Link 1][l_1] to install easy_install. Then find easy_install inside python 
	installation directory (usually under folder "Scripts"), 


Some WARNINGs:

	==========================================================================
	WARNING: The C extension could not be compiled, speedups are not enabled.
	Failure information, if any, is above.
	Retrying the build without the C extension now.

	==========================================================================
	WARNING: The C extension could not be compiled, speedups are not enabled.
	Plain-Python installation succeeded.
	==========================================================================
	Adding MarkupSafe 0.18 to easy-install.pth file
	  
It seemed everything work fine. So I ignored above warnings.

###Install Markdown package to support markdown syntax

	easy_install Markdown
	
There seemed to be a problem on my Windows 8. Easy_install downloaded the installed but failed to
run it. So I run it manually. (Discovered the downloaded folder inside the errors
reported by **easy_install**)

#2. Configure

##2.1 Learn Markdown (or something else)

Pelican supports many simply-markup language including markdown and reStructured Text etc.
I chose markdown because I have previous experience with them. See [my markdown show 
case]({filename}../Computer_Tips/Markdown Showcase.md). Choose whatever you like by Google it.


##2.2 Learn Pelican
  
##2.2.1 Kick Start  
*See :*[Basic Usage][getp_bu] and [Kickstart Your Site][ksys]
[getp_bu]:http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.3.0/getting_started.html#basic-usage
[ksys]:http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.3.0/getting_started.html#kickstart-your-site

You can create a skeleton project via the pelican-quickstart command, which 
begins by asking some questions about your site:  

	pelican-quickstart

Then view the output page:   

	firefox(or something else) output\index.html

However, Because the above method may have trouble locating your CSS and other
linked assets, running a simple web server using Python will often provide a 
more reliable previewing experience:  
	cd output && python -m SimpleHTTPServer  
*Note :* In python 3, modulus `SimpleHTTPServer` has been replaced by `http.server`



###2.2.2 Some automation tools

*See :*[Automation Tools][a_t]

To easy my way of editing and publishing, I choose *Fabric*

###2.2.2 Push to Github Pages

+ Change the output directory:

Because the I want to use git to control my blogs, I setup something.

1. Put the files to be read by pelican into a sub folder where html files are generated. Now,
website generated by Pelican reside in the parent folder and the content read by Pelican is in
a sub folder. This seperates the websites and files to be read by Pelican and in the mean time
allow both Github Page to read file `index.html` as well as Pelican to read its files without
interface each other.

2. Change the output directory to parent folder.
	In default setting file `pelicanconf.py`, add:
	
		OUTPUT_PATH = '../'
	

3. Generate files.

	Skipped.

4. Push to Github

	Follow guide [Here](http://pages.github.com/) to create a "User or organization site".

	Then clone the the source, copy your prepared Pelican generated websites (including where you store
	the files read by Pelican) to the cloned folder. Commit and Push and Done with your first blog!

Detailed settings of Pelican can be seen here:[Pelican Settings][pel_help_set]

###2.2.3 Using other's themes.

> The only way to become a master is to learn from the master.  

*(so to learn, copy first)*

Some websites built on Pelican:[Powered by Pelican][ped_by_pc]

Some good themes:  
Site:<http://omphalosskeptic.github.io>  
Source: <https://github.com/omphalosskeptic/omphalosskeptic.github.io>  
   
Site: <http://kylefuller.co.uk/>  
Source: <https://github.com/kylef/kylefuller.co.uk>

#Some websites:

* **Recommend** [Pelican Official Doc](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.3.0/)
* **Recommend** Some cases you can learn from [Powered by Pelican]
(https://github.com/getpelican/pelican/wiki/Powered-by-Pelican)

# Problem Solver:

* In Pelican: `'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xbe in position 2458: invalid start byte`  
	**Why:** Some files are stored in encoding GBK (or something else other than 
UTF-8) which is not supported by Pelican by default. Since python (and almost everything else) suppports utf-8, use some text
editor (mine is notepad++) to change encoding to utf-8. [SOLVED]


# Tips

1. Pelican does not provide a overall view of tags or categories already exist. However, you can find all the tags and categories in the output folder easily.
