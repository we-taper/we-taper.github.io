Markdown Tips
========

* Using Markdown On Notepad++

	At first I want to using markdown inside Vim. However, the 
	configuration and learning cost force me to turn to notepad++.
	After some search, found two plugins:

	1. ViSimulator - Make notepad++ vim-like.
		Provide some basic functions, enough for me. Available at
		[Notepad++ Plugin Site][np_plugin] as well as the built-in
		Plugin Manager.
	2. NppMarkdown - Preview markdown instantly inside notepad++.
		Good. Although the parsing engine doesn't recognize "\#"
		as title mark. Alse, referenced link also not support. Pity.
		Available at [Notepad++ Plugin Site][np_plugin].  
	
	Installing is quite stright forward, guidance available at: [Np++ Wiki - Plugin][npw_pg]  
	(Actually, a little guess would be enough to install plugins.)
