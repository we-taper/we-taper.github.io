Some bad habits can ruin your health

In my view, bad habits can sometimes ruin one's health. A typical example is the improper amount of eating. Excessive coffee drinking could ruin your night and even make one addicted to the caffeine in coffee. Excessive drinking could do serious harm to your spleen. More seriously, long history of smoking could even results in development of lung cancer.
Another example would be the irregular eating habits. When you skip today's breakfast, you would have enough energy for your mind to operate through the morning. Additionally, if you eat too much before sleep, your body will gradually accumulate excessive amount of fat, which eventually leads to some disease like high blood pressure.
