<h2>1. Basic concept</h2>
<p><em>See:</em> <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Git-Basics">Git book - chapter 1.3</a></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Git is a "mini file system"</p>
<p>Git use a special <em>"snapshot"</em> to store changes made to file(see Git book, chapter 1.3).
Git knows every change you made to the file by calculating a SHA-1 checksum of files. Git 
does most things locally so you can work without a network connection. Nearly all operations 
on git are "adding files", which means you can experiment on anything without worrying if 
you can get back to the original state. Also, every git clone copies everything on the 
<em>"master"</em> branch, therefore even the main server where <em>"master"</em> code resides is shot, 
everything can be recovered.</p>

<p><strong>What we do on git?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A General Workflow on Git</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>You modify files in your working directory.</li>
<li>You stage the files, adding snapshots of them to your staging area.</li>
<li>You do a commit, which takes the files as they are in the staging area 
and stores that snapshot permanently to your Git directory.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<h3>1.1 Install Git</h3>
<p><em>See:</em><a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Installing-Git">Git book - chapter 1.4</a></p>
<p>I personally like the git plugin <em>EGit</em> (found on Eclipse Market) for Eclipse since I use Eclipse on Windows. However, I still remcommend a commandline git for exercising.</p>
<h3>1.2 Configure Git</h3>
<p><em>See:</em> <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup">Git book - chapter 1.5</a></p>
<p>Since I don't want to consider too much about git, skip this.
Update: At least, one should set his username and email address, which is required by git every time one do git push. I update my default name and email address by:</p>
<p>Code:
    git config --global user.name "we.taper"
    git config --global user.email "haha_youCantSee@balala.com"</p>
<h3>1.3 Get help</h3>
<hr />
<p><em>See:</em><a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup">Git book - chapter 1.6</a></p>
<p>Code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git help &lt;verb&gt;
git &lt;verb&gt; --help
man git-&lt;verb&gt;     #For Linux manual page
</pre></div>


<p><br></p>
<h2>2. Let's Rock</h2>
<h3>2.1 Get a Git Repository</h3>
<p><em>See:</em> <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository">Git book - chapter 2.1</a></p>
<p>Basically, we first <em>create</em> a repository somewhere, then others can <em>clone</em> this repository. After
cloning or creating, you can <em>add</em> files and then commit to the repository.</p>
<h4>Command List</h4>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span># Create
git init
# Add
git add FileName(support *)
# Commit
git commit -m &#39;Commit Comment&#39;
# Clone
git clone [url]
# Clone Examples
git clone git://github.com/schacon/grit.git NameOfDirectory # Git transfer protocol
git clone http(s)://github.com/schacon/grit.git # HTTP(s)
git clone user@server:/path.git # SSH
</pre></div>


<h3>2.2 Record change to Repository</h3>
<p><em>See:</em><a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository">Git book - chapter 2.2</a></p>
<p>The full Life Cycle of a File:</p>
<p><img alt="Life Cycle" src="http://git-scm.com/figures/18333fig0201-tn.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Unadded file are <strong>not</strong> tracked, so Git <strong>doesn't care</strong> about this files.</p>
<h4>Staged</h4>
<p>When files added (under the control of Git) once modified, it need to be staged to the staging
area. Command of stage is the same as add:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git add FileName # &quot;add&quot; is multi-purpose, can add and stage files.
</pre></div>


<h4>Ignored files.</h4>
<p>File <em>.gitignore</em> store patterns of file names which will be ignored by git. Rules
are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blank lines or lines starting with # are ignored.</li>
<li>Standard glob patterns work.</li>
<li>You can end patterns with a forward slash (/) to specify a directory.</li>
<li>
<p>You can negate a pattern by starting it with an exclamation point (!).</p>
<p><strong>Glob patterns</strong> are like simplified regular expressions that shells use. An <strong>astsrisk (*)</strong>
matches zero or more characters; <strong>[abc]</strong> matches any character inside the brackets (in this 
case a, b, or c); a <strong>question mark (?)</strong> matches a single character; and <strong>brackets</strong> enclosing 
characters separated by a hyphen([0-9]) matches any character in the range (in this case
0 through 9) .</p>
<p><em>See:</em><a href="http://unixhelp.ed.ac.uk/CGI/man-cgi?glob+7">Unix Man Page</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_%28programming%29">Wikipedia Page</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>See <em>"What happens?"</em></h4>
<p>To see the general status of <em>"Which file have been modified but unstatged"</em> or <em>"Which file have
been staged but uncommited?"</em>, use:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git statue
</pre></div>


<p>For more detailed information about what actually changed inside files, use <code>diff</code>:</p>
<p>See the difference between <strong>Working Directory</strong> and <strong>Staging Area</strong></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git diff
</pre></div>


<p>See the difference between <strong>Staging</strong> and <strong>Repository(Commited)</strong></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git diff --staged
</pre></div>


<h4>Now Commit</h4>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git commit  
# Will open a editor to edit the &quot;Commiting Message&quot;

git commit -a  
# Will makes Git automatically stage every file that is already tracked  
before doing the commit, letting you skip the git add part
</pre></div>


<h4>Remove files</h4>
<p>Remove from tracked file list:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git rm FileName
</pre></div>


<p>Remove from staged directory (file is kept in working directory):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git rm --cached FileName
</pre></div>


<p><strong>Note:</strong> Deleting files on harddrive doesn't delete them from git's tracked file list.
Instead ther are marked "delete" when you type <code>git status</code></p>
<h4>Moving Files</h4>
<p><strong>Note :</strong> "Rename" == "Moving to the <em>Same</em> directory"</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git mv file_from file_to
</pre></div>


<p>Above is equal to:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>mv file_from file_to
git rm file_from
git add file_to
</pre></div>


<h3>2.3 Git Basics - Undoing Things</h3>
<p><em>See </em>: <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Basics-Undoing-Things">Git book- chapter 2.4</a></p>
<h4>Git Command</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Change last commit  </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git commit --amend
</pre></div>


<p>This command takes your staging area and uses it for the commit. If you’ve made no
changes since your last commit (for instance, you run this command immediately after
your previous commit), then your snapshot will look exactly the same and all you’ll 
change is your commit message. The same commit-message editor fires up, but it already
contains the message of your previous commit. You can edit the message the same as
always, but it overwrites your previous commit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unstage File</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;...
</pre></div>


</li>
<li>
<p>Unmodifyed a File</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;...  
# Note: This cannot be undone since the file hasn&#39;t be commited
and therefore not recorded by git.
</pre></div>


</li>
</ul>
<h2>3 Branching</h2>
<h3>3.1 What a Branch Is</h3>
<p><em>See :</em> <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-What-a-Branch-Is"> Git book - chapter 3.1</a></p>
<p><strong>Note :</strong> Here I tried to make everything simple but if you wnat a true picture
of how  branch works in Git, please refer to the original document.</p>
<p>Git take <strong>snapshot</strong> of every version (commit) of your files. A <strong>Branch</strong> is just a 
diverged series of snapshots. Think of a tree which start with a <strong>master</strong> trunk, then
it can stretches out different <strong>branches</strong>. All this branches are linked with their 
parent (either a <strong>master</strong> trunk or a derived <strong>branch</strong>) with <strong>nodes</strong> - the mother 
snapshot they all share. To go back to a older version or another branch, just trace 
back to the <em>mother snapshot</em> and choose a different route.</p>
<p>Diagram of branches (named in <em>pointer</em> style):</p>
<p><img alt="Branch" src="http://git-scm.com/figures/18333fig0309-tn.png" /></p>
<h3>3.2 Basic Branching and Merging</h3>
<p><em>See :</em> <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging0">Git book - chapter 3.2</a></p>
<p><strong>Git commands:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Create a branch:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git branch NAME
</pre></div>


</li>
<li>
<p>Switch to a branch:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git checkout NAME
</pre></div>


</li>
<li>
<p>Create and Switch (shortened):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git checkout -b iss53 #equal:git branch iss53 \ git checkout iss53
</pre></div>


</li>
<li>
<p>Delete a branch:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git branch -d NAME
# Note: Delete a branch. The branch must be fully merged in its upstream branch, or in HEAD if no upstream was set with --track or --set-upstream.
</pre></div>


</li>
<li>
<p>Merge a branch:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git merge NAME 
# Note: the &quot;NAME&quot; branch will be merged into current branch you are working on.
</pre></div>


</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note :</strong> </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Switch (chekout):</p>
<p>Git resets your working directory to look like the snapshot of the commit that the 
branch you check out points to. It adds, removes, and modifies files automatically 
to make sure your working copy is what the branch looked like on your last commit 
to it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Merge:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>"Fast-forward":</p>
<p>When the commit pointed to by the branch you merged in is directly upstream of 
the commit you’re on, Git moves the pointer forward. To phrase that another way,
when you try to merge one commit with a commit that can be reached by following
the first commit’s history, Git simplifies things by moving the pointer forward
because there is no divergent work to merge together — this is called a "fast 
forward".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Resolve Conflicts:</p>
<p>If you changed the same part of the same file differently in the two branches you’re merging together, Git won’t be able to merge them cleanly. Git has paused the process while you should resolve the conflict. Now you should see which files are unmerged at any point after a merge conflict running <code>git status</code></p>
<p>Git adds standard conflict-resolution markers to the files that have conflicts, so when you open them you can manually resolve those conflicts. Your file contains a section that looks something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD
contact : email.support@github.com&lt;br&gt;
=======
please contact us at support@github.com&lt;br&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; iss53
</pre></div>


<p>This means the version in <strong>HEAD</strong> (The branch where you are working in, which is what you had checked out when you ran your merge command) is the top part of that block (everything above the <code>=======</code>), while the version in your <strong>iss53</strong> branch looks like everything in the bottom part. In order to resolve the conflict, you have to either choose one side or the other or merge the contents yourself. You resovle conflicts by editing and then staging the file.</p>
<p>After you’ve resolved each of these sections in each conflicted file, run <code>git add</code> to add each file to mark it as resolved. Staging the file marks it as resolved in Git. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you want to use a graphical tool to resolve these issues, you can run <code>git mergetool</code>, which fires up an appropriate visual merge tool and walks you through the conflicts. After you exit the merge tool, Git asks you if the merge was successful. If you tell the script that it was, it stages the file to mark it as resolved for you.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>If you’re happy with that, and you verify that everything that had conflicts has been staged, you can type `git commit` to finalize the merge commit.
</pre></div>


</li>
</ol>
<h3>3.3 Working with remote branch</h3>
<p><em>See :</em><a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Remote-Branches">Git book - chapter 3.5</a> 
as well as <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Basics-Working-with-Remotes">Git book - chapter 2.5</a></p>
<p><strong>What ? :</strong> Remote branches are just branches pointed to remote serves, taking the form of <code>(remote)/(branch)</code> except that you can not move them as fre as the local one. However, remote branches can be modified without noticing, so please synchronize it frequently.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>See Status</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git remote command
</pre></div>


<p>It lists the shortnames of each remote handle you’ve specified. If you’ve cloned your repository, you should at least see origin — that is the default name Git gives to the server you cloned from.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git remote -v
</pre></div>


<p>It shows you the URL that Git has stored for the shortname to be expanded to.  </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git remote show [remote-name]
</pre></div>


<p>It lists the URL for the remote repository as well as the tracking branch information. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add<br />
        git remote add [shortname] [url]<br />
    e.g.<br />
        git remote add pb git://github.com/paulboone/ticgit.git<br />
    Now you can use the string <em>pb</em> on the command line in lieu of the whole URL.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fetch<br />
        git fetch [remote-name]<br />
    e.g.<br />
        git fetch pb<br />
<strong>Note :</strong> The fetch command pulls the data to your local repository — it doesn’t automatically merge it with any of your work or modify what you’re currently working on. You only have an <code>origin/remote</code> pointer that you can’t modify. You have to merge it manually into your work when you’re ready.  </p>
<p>To merge this work into your current working branch, you can run <code>git merge origin/remote</code>. If you want your own remote branch that you can work on, you can base it off your remote branch:  </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git checkout -b remote_in_local origin/remote
</pre></div>


</li>
<li>
<p>Push to Upstream<br />
        git push [remote-name] [branch-name]<br />
    This command works only if you cloned from a server to which you have write
    access and if nobody has pushed in the meantime. If you and someone else clone
    at the same time and they push upstream and then you push upstream, your push
    will rightly be rejected. You’ll have to pull down their work first and
    incorporate it into yours before you’ll be allowed to push. </p>
<p>You can push a local branch into a remote branch that is named differently.  </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git push [remotename] [localbranch]:[remotebranch]
</pre></div>


<p>Like, if you didn’t want it to be called <em>"aaaaa"</em> on the remote, you could instead run:   </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git push origin aaaaa:awesomebranch
</pre></div>


<p>to push your local <em>"aaaaa"</em> branch to the <em>"awesomebranch"</em> branch on the remote project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rename  </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git remote rename OLD_NAME NEW_NAME
</pre></div>


</li>
<li>
<p>Remove local</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git remote rm paul [remote-name]
</pre></div>


<p>It removes a reference for the remote branch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Delete Remote Branch</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git push [remotename] :[branch]  
# Here, you just leave the LocalBranch&#39;s name empty!
</pre></div>


<p>e.g, If you want to delete your serverfix branch from the server, you run the following:  </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git push origin :serverfix
</pre></div>


<p><strong>Note:</strong>  A way to remember this command is by recalling the <code>git push [remotename] [localbranch]:[remotebranch]</code> syntax that we went over a bit earlier. If you leave off the [localbranch] portion, then you’re basically saying, “Take nothing on my side and make it be [remotebranch].”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clone it.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span> git clone [url]
</pre></div>


<p>If you clone from this, Git automatically names it origin for you, pulls down all its data, creates a pointer to where its master branch is, and names it origin/master locally; and you can’t move it. Git also gives you your own master branch starting at the same place as origin’s master branch, so you have something to work from. See:<br />
<img alt="Clone Remote" src="http://git-scm.com/figures/18333fig0322-tn.png" /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tracking Branch</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>See:</em> <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Remote-Branches#Tracking-Branches">Git book - 3.5 Tracking Branches</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Using tracking branches can really save you some effort. *</li>
</ul>
<p>Tracking branches are local branches that have a direct relationship to a remote branch. If you’re on a tracking branch and type git push, Git automatically knows which server and branch to push to. Also, running git pull while on one of these branches fetechs all remote references and automatically merges in the corresponding remote branch.</p>
<p>Check out:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git chekcout --track RemoteName/BranchName
# Or, below gives it a new name
git checkout -b NewName RemoteName/BranchName
</pre></div>


<h3>3.4 Rebasing</h3>
<p><em>See:</em> <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Rebasing">Git book - 3.6 Rebase</a></p>
<p>In effect, rebasing is the same as merge, and the whole process is very alike. You have to <em>rebase</em> --&gt; <em>solve confilicts</em> --&gt; <em>git add to mark solved</em> --&gt; <em>continue rebase</em>. However, rebase eliminate the number of different branches and thus makes the history of coding more clear and concise.</p>
<p>Commands:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git rebase branchToBeBased # Here may exists conflicts.
git rebase --continue # Contine after solving the conflicts.
git rebase --skip # Skip the patch.
git rebase --abort # Give up this rebasing.
</pre></div>


<p>More detailed information: <a href="http://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase">Git Manual - Rebase</a>.</p>
<h2>4. Github</h2>
<h3>4.1 Add your local file to Github</h3>
<p>First, you should setting up an account in Github. It's rather easy.</p>
<p>Then, if you want to push a local repository to Github. First create an empty one on Github and then add it to your local git remote branch by:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git remote AName UrlToRemoteRepo
</pre></div>


<p>Then push:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git push AName LocalBranch
</pre></div>


<h3>4.2 Fork others' and contribute</h3>
<p>To contribute to other's project, you should: <em>Fork his project by <code>git checkout</code> or Fork button on Github</em> --&gt; <em>Push your modifications to your own Github</em> --&gt; <em>Make a Pull Request on Github to Contribute</em>.</p>
<p>There is a green button on your repo's page called <strong>Compare, review, create a pull request</strong>. You just need to click it and adjust something, fill some commit message. Then Github will take care of the pull request on its serve.</p>
<h3>4.3 Access Github by SSH</h3>
<p>See: <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys">Generate SSH Keys - Github Doc</a></p>
<p>Git support SSH link. By this, Git can control the access ability. When you checkout something on Github by simple url, you would not have write access to the remote branch. If you try to push, git will ask for your username and password on Github.</p>
<p>In order to have write access, you would need a personal SSH key. SSH key helps to identify users without a user account and password combination.</p>
<p>To generate ssh key, you should have some ssh client in your computer. If you install Git from the official source, it will install a Git Bash, where it provide a <code>ssh-keygen</code> to generate ssh keys.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>ssh-keygen -t rsa -C &quot;YourEmail@Address.com&quot;
</pre></div>


<p>This will create a ssh key of your own and ask you for where to store and a passphrase.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Something about Passphrase</strong>:</p>
<p>Why do passphrases matter?: </p>
<p>From: <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys">Generate SSH Keys - Github Doc</a></p>
<p>Passwords aren't very secure. If you use one that's easy to remember, it's easier to guess or brute-force (try many options until one works). If you use one that's random, it's hard to remember, and thus you're more inclined to write it down. Both of these are Very Bad Things™.</p>
<p>This is why you're using SSH keys. But, using a key without a passphrase is basically the same as writing down that random password. Anyone who gains access to your computer has gained access to every system you use that key with. This is also a Very Bad Thing™. The solution is to add a passphrase to the SSH key, for an extra layer of security.</p>
<p><em>But I don't want to enter a long passphrase every time I use the key!</em></p>
<p>Neither do we! Thankfully, there's a nifty little tool called ssh-agent that can securely save your passphrase so you don't have to re-enter it. If you're on OSX Leopard or later, your keys can be saved in the system's keychain, which makes your life even easier. Unfortunately, it takes a little work to get it up and running on Windows.</p>
<hr />
<p>Then, copy the public key where you store you key and paste it into you Github's "Account Settings" --&gt; "SSH Keys". Don't confuse the public with the private key. Public key usually stores in file name <em>xxx.pub</em> while private is usually the same name but without a file extension <em>.pub</em></p>
<p>Next, clone the repo with SSH url (or Git URL):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git clone git@github.com:we-taper/vim-pathogen.git
</pre></div>
